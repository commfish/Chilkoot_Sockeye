# Chilkoot Lake Sockeye Salmon Escapement Goal Analysis
Bayesian spawner-recruit analysis of Chilkoot Lake sockeye salmon. Replaces the "Alaska Salmon" repository

Chilkoot Lake is a glacial system located on the mainland, approximately 13 km northwest of Haines, Alaska. The Chilkoot drainage supports one of the larger runs of sockeye salmon in the region, which is harvested primarily in the District 15 Lynn Canal commercial drift gillnet fishery and in a subsistence fishery in Lutak Inlet. Escapements have been enumerated annually at an adult counting weir in the Chilkoot River, below the outlet of the lake, since 1976. 

## Escapement Goals and Stock Status:  
This stock was managed for informal escapement goals of 80,000–100,000 sockeye salmon starting in 1976, and 60,000–80,000 sockeye salmon starting in 1981 (McPherson 1990). In 1990, ADF&G established a biological escapement goal range of 50,500–91,500 sockeye salmon divided into separate goals for early- and late-runs, based on a stock-recruit analysis (McPherson 1990). The run underwent an extended downturn in production in the 1990s related to changes in the lake rearing environment, which is glacially turbid; very warm summers increased the silt load in the lake, which greatly reduced zooplankton abundance (Eggers et al. 2009). An extremely low weir count in 1995 prompted ADF&G to verify weir counts with mark–recapture studies, which were conducted in 12 years between 1996 and 2011 (Bachman et al. 2014). Mark–recapture estimates were greater than weir counts, consistent with the idea that weir counts likely under-represented total escapement, but differences between the two estimates were not consistent enough to calibrate weir counts. Geiger et al. (2005) recommended maintaining essentially the same escapement goal range, 50,000–90,000 sockeye salmon, but reclassified the goal as a sustainable escapement goal. In 2009, the escapement goal was changed to a sustainable escapement goal range of 38,000–86,000 sockeye salmon based on an updated stock-recruit analysis (Eggers et al. 2008, 2009). The goal was considered a sustainable goal, rather than a biological goal, due to uncertainty in weir counts. Recent reviews (Brenner et al. 2018) suggest the escapement goal should remain unchanged until returns from the very large brood year 2019 escapement can be incorporated into the analysis. From 2015 to 2019, escapements were within or above the escapement goal range in each year.
